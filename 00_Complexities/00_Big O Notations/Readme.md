# Big O Notation

`Big O notation` is a way of measuring the `performance` of an `algorithm` or data structure, specifically the time complexity or the amount of resources (such as memory) used. The notation describes how the runtime of an algorithm or the amount of resources used by a data structure grows in relation to the size of the input i.e. it describes the worst-case scenario for the number of operations an algorithm will perform, and is often used to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.

# Representation
It's usually represented with the letter "O" followed by a function that describes the growth of the runtime or resources used. For example, O(1) means the algorithm or data structure has a constant runtime or resource usage, regardless of the size of the input. O(n) means the runtime or resource usage grows linearly with the size of the input, and O(n^2) means the runtime or resource usage grows quadratically with the size of the input.

# Examples of common Big O complexities

Here are a few examples of common time complexities:

- O(1) : constant time, for example, accessing an element in an array by its index or checking if a number is even or odd.
- O(log n) : logarithmic time, for example, searching for an element in a sorted array using binary search.
- O(n) : linear time, for example, searching for an element in an unsorted array by checking each element one by one.
- O(n log n) : log-linear time, for example, sorting an array using merge sort or quick sort.
- O(n^2) : quadratic time, for example, sorting an array using bubble sort or insertion sort.
- O(2^n) : exponential time, for example, generating all subsets of a set.
- O(n!) : factorial time, for example, generating all permutations of a set.

# Note
It's important to note that Big O notation describes the worst-case scenario, and the actual performance of an algorithm or data structure may be better in some cases.

Big O notation is a powerful tool for analyzing algorithms and data structures, and it allows you to quickly compare the performance of different approaches and make informed decisions about which one to use for a specific problem.

# Conclusions
In summary, Big O notation is a way to measure the performance of an algorithm or data structure. It describes the growth of the runtime or resources used in relation to the size of the input, and it's usually represented with the letter "O" followed by a function that describes the growth. There are different types of complexities such as constant, logarithmic, linear, log-linear, quadratic, exponential and factorial time which can be represented by O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n) and O(n!) respectively.





What is Big O Notation?
Big O notation is a way of describing the performance of an algorithm, specifically the time complexity of an algorithm. It describes the worst-case scenario for the number of operations an algorithm will perform, and is often used to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.

How to read Big O notation
Big O notation is written in the form of O(n), where n is the input size. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) will perform an amount of operations proportional to the input size. An algorithm with a time complexity of O(1) will always perform a constant number of operations, regardless of the input size.

Common Big O complexities
Here are some common Big O complexities and examples of algorithms that have them:

O(1): Constant time. An example of an algorithm with O(1) time complexity is looking up an element in an array by its index.

O(log n): Logarithmic time. An example of an algorithm with O(log n) time complexity is binary search.

O(n): Linear time. An example of an algorithm with O(n) time complexity is iterating through an array and printing each element.

O(n log n): Log-linear time. An example of an algorithm with O(n log n) time complexity is merge sort.

O(n^2): Quadratic time. An example of an algorithm with O(n^2) time complexity is bubble sort.

O(2^n): Exponential time. An example of an algorithm with O(2^n) time complexity is the recursive solution to the Fibonacci sequence.

Best and worst case
It's important to note that Big O notation describes the worst-case scenario for an algorithm. However, there are also best-case scenarios, which are denoted using the notation Ω(n). For example, an algorithm with a best-case time complexity of Ω(1) will always perform a constant number of operations, regardless of the input size.

The average case of an algorithm is usually denoted by Theta (Θ) notation.

Conclusion
Big O notation is a useful tool for analyzing and comparing the performance of different algorithms. By understanding the time complexity of an algorithm, we can make informed decisions about which algorithm to use for a given problem. However, it's important to keep in mind that Big O notation only describes the worst-case scenario, and there may be other factors to consider when choosing an algorithm.
